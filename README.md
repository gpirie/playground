# DMG Read More Plugin

This WordPress plugin provides two key features:

1. A **Gutenberg block** that allows editors to insert a stylized "Read More" link to any published post.
2. A **WP-CLI command** to search for posts containing that block within a specific date range.

## üîß Features

- Lets editors **search for and select** a published post from the **InspectorControls** sidebar.
- **Search supports:**
    - Partial post titles
    - Specific post IDs
    - Pagination of results
- **Recent posts** are displayed by default when no search term is entered.
- Inserts a stylized anchor link into the editor:

  ```
- Selecting a new post **dynamically updates** the preview in the editor.
